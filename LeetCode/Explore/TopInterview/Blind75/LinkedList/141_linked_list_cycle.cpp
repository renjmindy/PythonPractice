// Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm

// Complexity analysis
// Time complexity : O(n)O(n). Let us denote nn as the total number of nodes in the linked list. To analyze its time complexity, we consider the following two cases separately.

// List has no cycle:
// The fast pointer reaches the end first and the run time depends on the list's length, which is O(n)O(n).

// List has a cycle:
// We break down the movement of the slow pointer into two steps, the non-cyclic part and the cyclic part:

// The slow pointer takes "non-cyclic length" steps to enter the cycle. At this point, the fast pointer has already reached the cycle. 
// \text{Number of iterations} = \text{non-cyclic length} = NNumber of iterations=non-cyclic length=N

// Both pointers are now in the cycle. Consider two runners running in a cycle - the fast runner moves 2 steps while the slow runner moves 1 steps at a time. 
// Since the speed difference is 1, it takes \dfrac{\text{distance between the 2 runners}}{\text{difference of speed}} difference of speed distance between the 2 runners
// â€‹ loops for the fast runner to catch up with the slow runner. As the distance is at most "\text{cyclic length K}cyclic length K" and the speed difference is 1, 
// we conclude that \text{Number of iterations} = \text{almost}Number of iterations=almost "\text{cyclic length K}cyclic length K".
// Therefore, the worst case time complexity is O(N+K)O(N+K), which is O(n)O(n).

// Space complexity : O(1)O(1). We only use two nodes (slow and fast) so the space complexity is O(1)O(1).
