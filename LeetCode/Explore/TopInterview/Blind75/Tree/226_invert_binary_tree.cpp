// Recursive

// Complexity Analysis
// Since each node in the tree is visited only once, the time complexity is O(n)O(n), where nn is the number of nodes in the tree. 
// We cannot do better than that, since at the very least we have to visit each node to invert it.
// Because of recursion, O(h)O(h) function calls will be placed on the stack in the worst case, where hh is the height of the tree. 
// Because h\in O(n)hâˆˆO(n), the space complexity is O(n)O(n).
