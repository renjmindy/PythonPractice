# # Assignment 4
# 
# In this assignment, we will explore countmin sketches and bloom filters. We will use two text files `great-gatsby-fitzgerald.txt` and `war-and-peace-tolstoy.txt` to load up the text of two famous novels courtesy of Project Guttenberg. 
# 
# We will explore two tasks:
#   - Counting the frequency of words of length 5 or more in both novels using a count-min sketch 
#   - Using a bloom filter to approximately count how many words in the War and Peace novel already appears in the Great Gatsby.

# ## Step 1:  Making a Universal Hash Family (Already Done For You)
# 
# We will use a family of hash function that first starts by (a) generating a random prime number $p$ (we will use the Miller-Rabin primality test for this purpopse); (b) generating random numbers a, b between 2 and p-1.
# 
# The hash function $h_{a,b,p} (n) = (an + b) \mod p$. 
# 
# Note that this function will be between 0 and p-1. We will need to also make sure to take the hash value modulo $m$ where $m$ is the size of the hashtable.
# 
# To hash strings, we will first use python's inbuilt hash function and then use $h_{a,b,p}$ on the result.
# 
# As a first step, we will generate a random prime number.
# 
# ### (A) Generate Random Prime Numbers

import random 

# Utility function to do 
# modular exponentiation. 
# It returns (x^y) % p 
def power(x, y, p): 
	
	# Initialize result 
	res = 1; 
	
	# Update x if it is more than or 
	# equal to p 
	x = x % p; 
	while (y > 0): 
		
		# If y is odd, multiply 
		# x with result 
		if (y & 1): 
			res = (res * x) % p; 

		# y must be even now 
		y = y>>1; # y = y/2 
		x = (x * x) % p; 
	
	return res; 

# This function is called 
# for all k trials. It returns 
# false if n is composite and 
# returns false if n is 
# probably prime. d is an odd 
# number such that d*2<sup>r</sup> = n-1 
# for some r >= 1 
def miillerTest(d, n): 
	
	# Pick a random number in [2..n-2] 
	# Corner cases make sure that n > 4 
	a = 2 + random.randint(1, n - 4); 

	# Compute a^d % n 
	x = power(a, d, n); 

	if (x == 1 or x == n - 1): 
		return True; 

	# Keep squaring x while one 
	# of the following doesn't 
	# happen 
	# (i) d does not reach n-1 
	# (ii) (x^2) % n is not 1 
	# (iii) (x^2) % n is not n-1 
	while (d != n - 1): 
		x = (x * x) % n; 
		d *= 2; 

		if (x == 1): 
			return False; 
		if (x == n - 1): 
			return True; 

	# Return composite 
	return False; 

# It returns false if n is 
# composite and returns true if n 
# is probably prime. k is an 
# input parameter that determines 
# accuracy level. Higher value of 
# k indicates more accuracy. 
def isPrime( n, k): 
	
	# Corner cases 
	if (n <= 1 or n == 4): 
		return False; 
	if (n <= 3): 
		return True; 

	# Find r such that n = 
	# 2^d * r + 1 for some r >= 1 
	d = n - 1; 
	while (d % 2 == 0): 
		d //= 2; 

	# Iterate given nber of 'k' times 
	for i in range(k): 
		if (miillerTest(d, n) == False): 
			return False; 

	return True; 

# Driver Code 
# Number of iterations 
k = 4; 

print("All primes smaller than 100: "); 
for n in range(1,100): 
	if (isPrime(n, k)): 
		print(n , end=" ");

# ### Step 2: Universal Hash Families
# 
# We will provide three useful functions for you:
# 
#   - `get_random_hash_function`: Generate triple of numbers `(p, a, b)` at random, where p is  prime, a and b are numbers between 2 and p-1. The hash function $h_{p,a,b}(n)$ is given by $ (an + b) \mod p$.
#   
#   - `hashfun`: apply the random hash function on a number `num`.
#   - `hash_string`: apply the hash function on a string `hstr`. Note that the result is between 0 and p-1. If your hash table has size `m`, you should take a `mod m` on this result where you call `hash_string`.
#   
#   Please use these functions in your code below.

# In[2]:


# Get a random triple (p, a, b) where p is prime and a,b are numbers betweeen 2 and p-1
def get_random_hash_function():
    n = random.getrandbits(64)
    if n < 0: 
        n = -n 
    if n % 2 == 0:
        n = n + 1
    while not isPrime(n, 20):
        n = n + 1
    a = random.randint(2, n-1)
    b = random.randint(2, n-1)
    return (n, a, b)

# hash function fora number
def hashfun(hfun_rep, num):
    (p, a, b) = hfun_rep
    return (a * num + b) % p

# hash function for a string.
def hash_string(hfun_rep, hstr):
    n = hash(hstr)
    return hashfun(hfun_rep, n)    


# ## Step 3: Loading Data
# 
# We are going to load two files `great-gatsby-fitzgerald.txt` and `war-and-peace-tolstoy.txt` to load up the text of two famous novels courtesy of Project Guttenberg. We will filter all wordsd of length >= 5 and also count the frequency of each word in a dictionary. This will be fast because it is going to use highly optimized hashtable (dictionaries) built into python.

# In[3]:


# Let us load the "Great Gatsby" novel and extract all words of length 5 or more
filename = 'great-gatsby-fitzgerald.txt'
file = open (filename,'r')
txt = file.read()
txt = txt.replace('\n',' ')
words= txt.split(' ')
longer_words_gg = list(filter(lambda s: len(s) >= 5, words))
print(len(longer_words_gg))
# Let us count the precise word frequencies
word_freq_gg = {}
for elt in longer_words_gg:
    if elt in word_freq_gg:
        word_freq_gg[elt] += 1
    else:
        word_freq_gg[elt] = 1
print(len(word_freq_gg))


# In[4]:


# Let us load the "War and Peace" novel by Tolstoy translation and extract all words of length 5 or more
filename = 'war-and-peace-tolstoy.txt'
file = open (filename,'r')
txt = file.read()
txt = txt.replace('\n',' ')
words= txt.split(' ')
longer_words_wp = list(filter(lambda s: len(s) >= 5, words))
print(len(longer_words_wp))
word_freq_wp = {}
for elt in longer_words_wp:
    if elt in word_freq_wp:
        word_freq_wp[elt] += 1
    else:
        word_freq_wp[elt] = 1
print(len(word_freq_wp))


# ## Problem 1: Implement count-min sketch
# 
# Implement `CountMinSketch` class below where `num_counters` is the number of counters.  You are given the constructor that already generates a random representative of a hash function family. Implement the functions:
#   - `increment`
#   - `approximateCount`.
#   
# Please read the constructor carefully: it initializes the counters and generates the hash function for you.
# Also, when you call `hash_string` function defined previously, do not forget to take result modulo m.

# ### Problem 1B
# 
# Check the data obtained above with calculations along the lines of what was done in class. If we had
# $5$ banks of counters  with $5000$ counters each and a uniform hash function family, what is the probability that when counting a total of $N = 2.5\times 10^{5}$ words, we have a discrepency by 80 or more.

# ## Problem 2: Using a Bloom Filter to Count Common Words.
# 
# In this problem, we will implement a Bloom filter to count how many elements of `longer_words_wp` (the words of length 5 or more in War and Peace) appear in the Great-Gatsby novel.  To do so, we will do the following:
#  - Instantiate a Bloom filter with number of bits `n` and number of hash functions `k`.
#  - Insert all words from great-gatsby into the filter.
#  - For each word from war and peace, check membership in the Bloom filter and count the number of yes answers.

# ## Problem 2 B
# 
# Given a Bloom filter with $m = 100000$ bits and $k = 5$ hash functions that  map each key uniformly at random to one of the bits (assumption), estimate the probability that $k$ bits $i_1, \ldots, i_k$ are simultaneously set when $n = 10000$ words are inserted. Assume that whether or not a particular bit is set is independent of another.

# YOUR ANSWER HERE

# ## Manually Graded Solutions
# 
# ### Problem 1 B 
# 
# 
# Note that for each word we have $\mathbb{E}( \text{approxCount}(word) - \text{count}(word)) \leq \frac{N}{m}$.
# The probability that for some word, the approximate count differs from the real one by at least $80$ for one of the counter banks is bounded by Markov Inequality as:  
# $$ \mathbb{P}( \text{approxCount}(word) - \text{count}(word) \geq 80) \leq \frac{\mathbb{E}(\text{approxCount}(word) - \text{count}(word))}{80} \leq \frac{2.5\times 10^5}{80 \times 5000} \approx \frac{5}{8} $$.
# 
# The probability that this happens for all five counter banks is bounded by $\left(\frac{5}{8}\right)^5 \approx 0.095$.
# 
# 
# However, this bound happens to be not so tight. Empirically, we see that this happens for roughly one word out of the nearly quarter million words in the corpus.
# 
# ### Problem 2 B
# 
# The probability that any given bit is not set when $n$ words are inserted is 
# $(1 - \frac{1}{m})^{kn} = (1 - \frac{1}{100000})^{5\times 10000} = e^{-0.5}$.
# 
# The probability that all five bits are simultaneously set is $(1-e^{-0.5})^5 = 0.009$.
# 
# Therefore, we will expect the false positive rate to be roughly $1\%$.
# 

# ## That's All Folks!
