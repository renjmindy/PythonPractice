# Write a recursive function that will return the longest word in a sentence. In cases where more than one word is found, return the first one.
# 
# **Examples**
# 
# findLongest("I will and ever will be gratefully and perpetually loving you Tesh!â€‹ðŸ˜˜â€‹") âžž "perpetually"
# 
# findLongest("A thing of beauty is a joy forever.") âžž "forever"
# 
# findLongest("Forgetfulness is by all means powerless!") âžž "forgetfulness"
# 
# findLongest("The word strengths is the longest and most commonly used word with a single vowel.") âžž "strengths"
# 
# **Notes**
# 
# Special characters and symbols don't count as part of the word.
# 
# Return the longest word found in lowercase letters.
# 
# You are expected to solve this challenge via a recursive approach.
