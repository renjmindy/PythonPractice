Question 2
Which one of the following is true?

1 / 1 point

The address of any memory location in the stack is larger than the address of any memory location in the heap.

The C++ statement “int i;” allocates memory for one integer on the heap.

The "new" operator allocates memory on the stack that gets removed from the stack by the "delete"operator.

You should avoid using the memory address 0x0 for pointers whose value is not yet set, because memory location 0x0 is a valid location for the system to allocate to hold the contents of a variable.

Correct
The stack begins at a high memory address and works its way down, whereas the heap begins at a low memory address and works its way up.

Question 3
Suppose we are writing the following function that is intended to return a pointer to a location in memory holding an integer value initialized to zero. 

`int *allocate_an_integer() {
`    // declare variable i here
`    *i = 0;
`    return i;
`}

How should variable i be declared?

1 / 1 point

int i;

int *i;

int *i = new int;

int j; int *i = &j;

Correct
The variable i should be a pointer to a memory location to an integer allocated from the heap so the memory location continues to be allocated after the function has returned.
