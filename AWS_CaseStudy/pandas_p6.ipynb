My husband and I were excited to go, especially because it also boasted a beautiful rooftop dining patio.  The experience was neat, as the entrance is an unmarked door in an alley and after being checked off the reservations list were escorted up an old industrial elevator to the top floor.  We had the place to ourselves which was a little weird at 6:30 on a Saturday night.  This meant our waitress was very attentive.  The wine list was short and expensive but did have a bottle of Canadian red which was delicious.  The food was very expensive as well and was fine, but not delicious and worth the cost ($50/main mean plus $7/side vegetables).  The salmon appetizer was very disappointing since it was just a couple slabs of cold salmon and no flavor profile.  The ambiance was very nice, though there is no view since it is squashed between taller buildings.                                             2       1po30PVblm1zJbfvM71BRA    0.000383\n",

I left with an oil change. 1 out of the 4 things I asked for was completed.  The reason I know nothing got done was it was not on my receipt for checking the fluids and I mark my tires to make sure they do a tire rotation.  I got home and my same mark was on my drivers side front tire.  Called them back and they said since my tires were worn that they can't rotate them...um b.s. They flat out did not do it.  This was after they would not prorate me for new tires that I bought from them and got 35,000 miles on 65,000 mile tires. They said I needed to have tire rotation records (which I do have just not from Brian's).  How do you get tire rotation records when you don't rotate the tires?  When I called Bridgestone about my tire warranty they said to not go there (Brian's) and go to another place   Shady place..be careful.  1       yD1NqQR3hfuq29hCLUVtvQ    0.000383\n",

Arrived for a late Thursday morning breakfast (11am) and only had to wait 5-10 minutes. Server was friendly and I had the chorizo scramble special. It was great! Very tasty and flavorful. I am one of the pickiest breakfast eaters (i.e. I don't really consider US Egg & Denny's breakfast places). I expect my eggs and all the ingredients to be fresh, and that was certainly the case at Matt's!! This is one of my two favorite breakfast places in the valley (for different reasons, I consider Matt's and the Orange Table to be complimentary).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0       LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg    0.000383\n",

But whenever you need to quickly apply some simple processing to a collection of data you have a new technique that will help you to do just that. It'll also be useful if you're reading someone else's code that happens to use lambdas."
